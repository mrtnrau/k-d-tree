# Multidimensional Binary Search Trees

This repository provides a formalization of multidimensional binary trees, also known as k-d trees. It
includes a balanced build algorithm as well as the nearest neighbor algorithm and the range search
algorithm. It is based on the papers [Multidimensional binary search trees used for associative
searching][1] and [An Algorithm for Finding Best Matches in Logarithmic Expected Time][2].

To install and use this formalization, please refer to this [entry][3] in Isabelle's Archive of Formal Proofs.
